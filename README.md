**Descriptions:**

- In this track, I have chances to review and summarize the skills in importing, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization data with Python. 
- Through interactive exercises, the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more are used again and again to make skills more fluently. 
- Chance to work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).
